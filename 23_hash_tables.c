- A hash table in C/C++ is a data structure that maps keys to values. A hash
table uses a hash function to compute indexes for a key. The benefit of using a
hash table is its very fast access time. Typically, the time complexity
(amortized time complexity) is a constant O(1) access time.
- A hash table is a container data structure that allows to quickly look up a
key (often a string) to find its corresponding value (any data type). Under the
hood, theyâ€™re arrays that are indexed by a hash function of the key. A hash
function turns a key into a random-looking number, and it must always return the
same number given the same key. It implements an abstract array data type.
- When the hash function generates the same index for multiple keys, there will
be a conflict (what value to be stored in that index). This is called a hash
collision. This can be resolved using Chaining or Open Addressing. A good hash
function may not prevent the collisions completely however it can reduce the
number of collisions.
- In chaining, if a hash function produces the same index for multiple elements,
these elements are stored in the same index by using a doubly-linked list. The
value returned by the Hash function is the bucket index for a key in a separate
chaining method. Each index in the array is called a bucket as it is a bucket of
a linked list.
- Unlike chaining, open addressing doesn't store multiple elements into the same
slot. Here, each slot is either filled with a single key or left NIL. Linear
probing is a common technique. In linear probing, collision is resolved by
checking the next slot. If a collision occurs at h(k, 0), then h(k, 1) is
checked. In this way, the value of i is incremented linearly. The problem with
linear probing is that a cluster of adjacent slots is filled. When inserting a
new element, the entire cluster must be traversed. This adds to the time
required to perform operations on the hash table. In case of a quadratic probing
the space between the slots is increased. In double hashing if a collision
occurs after applying a hash function h(k), then another hash function is
calculated for finding the next slot that is h(k, i) = (h1(k) + ih2(k)) mod m.
- Hash tables are implemented where constant time lookup and insertion is
required, cryptographic applications and indexing data is required.
- Rehashing is a concept that reduces collision when the elements are increased
in the current hash table. It will make a new array of doubled size and copy the
previous array elements to it.
- The time complexity of hash table insertion and deletion operations is O(1) on
average. Time Complexity of Insertion - in the average case it is constant. In
the worst case, it is linear. Time Complexity of Search - in the average case it
is constant. In the worst case, it is linear. Time Complexity of Deletion - In
average cases it is constant. In the worst case, it is linear. Space Complexity
- O(n) as it has n number of elements.
